# Employee Attrition Project (SQL and PowerBI)

## Description
Analyzing employee attrition data for HR from Kaggle dataset to determine how to better retain employees using SQL and visualized results using PowerBI

## Installation

To view the SQL queries, we will be using SQL Server and download the Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  

## Business Problem
For this project, we are reviewing an issue that the HR deparment of IBM wanted to look deeper into. They noticed that employees have been leaving more frequently after new return to the office procedures were implemented than and wanted to pinpoint the exact issues so adjustments can be made. 

## Results
Based on the analysis, the following was determined:
  - The overall attrition rate was 16%
  - The departments with the highest attrition were Research & Development (R&D) and Sales
  - Attrition was due to a combination of traveling too far of a distance from home to go into the office, low relationship satisfaction, poor work/life balance, and traveling


## Conclusion to Improve Attrition
To improve the attrition rating, especially from R&D and sales, the following procedures will be implemented:
  - A hybrid work schedule where employees will be able to come into the office 1-2 times per week. This will be determined by role, as well as distance from the office. The futher from home, the less the employee would need to come in.
  - To build better relationships, there will be at least one social team outing per month         within each department to build a closer bond with coworkers.
  - For travel, limit to once per quarter and have it only be for department leaders and will adjust to have clients travel to IBM offices in some cases to ensure employees are home more often.
  - Lastly, monthly check-ins with each employee will take place between department heads - quarterly for executives - to see how employees are doing and performing.
